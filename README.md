# Cantos

## Motivation
This is a small experiment to play around with making a CLI Roguelike.
I am currently looking for a project to refresh my brain before RustConf2024.

A small CLI game is a fun option that gets me away from the usual distributed systems development at work, hopefully bringing me back to my systems programming roots. 

## Possible goals
- Turn this into a longer term endeavour that I can use as a hobby project for 1~2 years.
- Build out a set of various maps + components
- Integrate an LLM as a nonsense generator for characters / mobs / lore
- Maybe web hosted with WASM?
- Maybe an event system for multiplayer over NATS?
